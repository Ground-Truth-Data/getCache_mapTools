// Sparse GPS breadcrumb tracking.
//
// Toggled from the map drawer's TRACK tile. The `active` flag is read in
// two places: the tile (to show its depressed/ON state) and MobMapPage (to
// paint the soft-yellow "you're in tracking mode" border). Both are plain
// reactive reads of this singleton's $state — same pattern as mapStore.
//
// Data model: one "track" LineString feature on the active map, grown by
// one point per movement. Deliberately sparse — low battery + data, few
// points — and it persists / shares like any other feature for free.
//
// TWO SAMPLERS, picked by runtime:
//   • native — @capacitor-community/background-geolocation watcher. Runs with
//     the phone IN A POCKET: screen off, app backgrounded, whole hike. The OS
//     makes the session visible (Android: persistent notification; iOS: the
//     blue location indicator) — tracking is never invisible to the person
//     being tracked. distanceFilter does the sparse gating at the OS level.
//   • web (dt-web / mob-web) — a foreground setInterval + getCurrentPosition.
//     Browsers give a page nothing once the screen is off; that ceiling is
//     Safari's, not ours. Sessions keep running across in-app navigation
//     (the store is a singleton), just not with the screen off.
//
// ROBUSTNESS: a session survives a page reload / Safari tab refresh / app
// relaunch — a RESUME_KEY marker in localStorage lets boot re-attach to the
// same track feature (resume(), called from the mobile layout). And a session
// never ends SILENTLY: every stop — user tap, degenerate track, track deleted,
// permission revoked — says so with a toast.
