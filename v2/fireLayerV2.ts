/**
 * fireLayerV2 — the wildfire layer, rebuilt around one rule.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE RULE: PAINT IS `setData`. NOTHING ELSE.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * v1's paint path did, on every pan: a union across all cached discs, a
 * supersede test per (detection × newer disc), a convex-hull rebuild over
 * 12,197 cells, an urban classification pass, and a defensive deep clone of the
 * whole FeatureCollection. A Performance profile of an IDLE page put
 * `paintInner` at **63.6% of total main-thread time**, with `kmBetween` alone
 * at 30.1%, and the tab reached ~4,000 MB before crashing.
 *
 * Here, paint reads three strings off disk, `JSON.parse`s them, and calls
 * `setData` three times. There is no geometry step to get slow, so there is
 * nothing to memoize and nothing to accidentally run per-frame later. The
 * Worker did the work — see `fireFetchV2.ts`.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS IDENTICAL TO V1, ON PURPOSE ──
 * Same layer ids, same colours, same zoom gates, same cluster aggregation, same
 * tap card. A planter must not be able to tell which version is running. Every
 * constant below was tuned against a real field complaint, and each one carries
 * the reason it has the value it has.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS SAFE ──
 * Clustering still uses Mapbox's NATIVE `cluster: true`, which runs in the GL
 * worker and was never the bottleneck. The Worker's own cluster payload is used
 * only for the zoomed-OUT tiers where shipping every point would be wasteful.
 * The outline arrives as finished polygons instead of being hulled on-device.
